# Very basic output to the screen. Writes whatever comes after 'puts'
puts 1 + 2

# Basic mathematical operations
puts 1.0 + 2.0
puts 2.0 * 3.0 
puts 5.0 - 8.0
puts 9.0 / 2.0

# Same operations with integers. Difference here with 'integer division; when it doesn't know right answer, it will round down and use integer answers.
puts 1+2
puts 2*3
puts 5-8
puts 9/2

# More complex expressions
puts 5 * (12-8) + -15
